    "3.  holds events occuring every few weeks.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We achieved our objectives and demonstrated several useful techniques along the way we :\n",
    "1.  worked with the [Python Meetup API client]\n",
    "2.  built a helper function to parse response objects into **meta** and **results** dataframes\n",
    "3.  built a helper function to loop through multiple API calls and [concat]-enate a list of pages into a single useful dataframe\n",
    "4.  Used pandas.DataFrame.[query] to sort and filter data of interest\n",
    "5.  Used pandas.DataFrame.[apply] to clean columns of data using custom helper functions\n",
    "6.  Used pandas.DataFrame.[describe] to get descriptive statistics that summarize\n",
    "    * the central tendency\n",
    "    * dispersion\n",
    "    * shape of our dataset's distribution\n",
    "7.  Used pandas.DataFrame.[merge] to join the **events** and **groups** dataframes to create a report of the events for our 10 biggest mega-groups in technology\n",
    "8.  Found a mega-group that shows enduring and increasing interest by its membership\n",
